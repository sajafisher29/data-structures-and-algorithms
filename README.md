Repository for Daily Code Challenges assigned in 301 and 401

# 301 Code Challenges
Each set contains up to 10 problems.

The daily challenges will be posted by the instructor at the end of lecture every day. Plan to focus on this task with your partner every day after class until 6 p.m., completing as much as possible during this time, then complete the remainder of the challenges on your own, as needed.

You will be working on these code challenges with a new partner every day. This will also be your partner for the paired lab. Code challenges that are assigned when heading into the weekend should be completed independently.

After lecture, get together with your partner and read through the daily set of challenges. Read the MDN documentation for the topic(s) of the day. Your instructor will also be sharing a YouTube playlist which contains tutorials on each topic. Each video is approximately ten minutes long and you are encouraged to integrate these videos into your workflow as you and your partner see fit.

# Reverse an Array
This is the first code challenge for Java 401.

## Challenge
Feature Task: Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

Stretch Goal: Implement the same feature with a different methodology.

## Approach & Efficiency
Being new to Java we focused on modifying the array based on the contents' index. We did not get to Big O in lecture and I don't know enough to confidently evaluate it. We put a best guess based on our reading in our whiteboarding solution.
