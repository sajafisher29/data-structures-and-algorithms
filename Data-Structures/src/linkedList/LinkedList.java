//At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.
//Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

 
    //Stretch Goal: Create a new branch called doubly-linked-list, and, using the resources available to you online, implement a doubly linked list (completely separate from your singly linked list).
